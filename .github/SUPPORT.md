# Support

For usage questions, documentation gaps, or onboarding help, please:

1. Review the README and guides inside the `docs/` directory.
2. Search existing issues to check whether your question was answered before.
3. If you still need assistance, reach out at contato@stdout.dev.br or open a new discussion thread once GitHub Discussions is enabled.

Please avoid using the bug tracker for general support.
